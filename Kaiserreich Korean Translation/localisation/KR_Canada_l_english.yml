### Ideas ###

CAN_nrc_idea:0 "국가 연구위원회"
CAN_nrc_idea_desc:0 "국가 연구위원회는 우리나라의 모든 연구 노력에 결정적인 역할을합니다. 자금 지원 확대와 일부 정치적 지원으로 우리는 과학 공동체 전체를 활성화시키고 일부 중요한 연구팀의 충성도를 확보 할 수 있게 됩니다."

CAN_work_camps:0 "직업 구호 캠프"
CAN_work_camps_desc:0 "노동 캠프의 개념은 일반 시민들에게는 그리 매력적이지 않을 수도 있지만 단순히 실업보다 낫습니다. 풍부하고 의미있는 일을 제공함으로써 우리는 야심찬 인프라 프로젝트를 시작할 수 있으며 사람들에게 직접 혜택을 줄 수 있습니다."

CAN_howes_conversion:0 "하우의 계획"
CAN_howes_conversion_desc:0 "세계대전에서 우리의 군수 산업의 문제는 무기 산업에 대한 정부의 개입을 촉진해야한다는 것을 분명히 보여주었습니다. C.D 하우에 따르면, 우리는 다른 충돌이 일어나기 전날 완전한 경제 동원을 가능하게 하고 평시에도 생산력을 극대화하기 위해 대부분의 공장에 보조금을 지급 할 것입니다."

CAN_bill_c_7_debate:0 "C-7 법안 논쟁"
CAN_bill_c_7_debate_desc:0 "C-7 법안 논쟁은 평범한 의회 논쟁보다 확실히 미래의 캐나다 길을 바꿀 것입니다. 정치적 영역의 모든 에너지와 영향력은이 단일 토론에서 소비되고 있으며, 우리가 다른 문제에 관여하는것을 방해합니다."

CAN_divided_nation:0 "분열된 정부"
CAN_divided_nation_desc:0 "우리 정부는 여러 입장으로 나뉘어져 있으며, 주요 정당들 사이에선 끊임없는 언쟁이 벌어지고 있습니다. 그 밖에, 캐나다를 본토 재정복의 발판으로 삼고 싶어하는 영국의 망명자들과 그들의 기행과 반공주의에 지친 캐나다 국민들 사이에 분명한 분열도 있습니다. 이는 현 정부를 완전히 마비시키고 있습니다."

CAN_country_united:0 "통일된 정부"
CAN_country_united_desc:0 "While the democratic process is alive and well, we have finally reached some sort of agreement on a common course for our country. With the fever dreams of an all-powerful English monarch doused, Canadian politicians are finally willing to support our cause."

CAN_mounties:0 "The Mounties"
CAN_mounties_desc:0 "In accordance with the Tories, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been given sweeping powers to survey and detain suspected dissidents. While many liberals now amount them to a sort of secret police, there is no doubting their efficiency in preventing unrest and dissent in our country, and any undesirable Syndicalist influences in the population."

king_new_companies:0 "New Crown Corporations"
king_new_companies_desc:0 "Strategic state investments in our country's industry allows us to rapidly and efficiently industrialise the vast Canadian lands without having to bear the responsibility of a nationalised industry. However, as the funds allocated dry up, the effects of this policy will eventually fade."

quebec_riots:0 "퀘벡의 폭동"
quebec_riots_desc:0 "우리의 애국 전쟁의 뉴스을 접한 퀘벡 사람들은 자국을 지키기를 거부하고 거리에 항의하기로했습니다. 그들 중 일부는 캐나다, 특히 영국인 엘리트가 통치하는 캐나다는 그들의 나라가 아니라고 말하고 있지만, 우리는 그 탈영자와 겁쟁이를 믿을만큼 어리석지 않습니다."

anglo_french_tensions:0 "영국계-프랑스계 긴장"
anglo_french_tensions_desc:0 "영국 정부의 망명과 전반적으로 좋지 않은 프랑스, 영국의 국제 정세로 인해, 영국계 캐나다인과 프랑스계 캐나다인의 오랜 경쟁 의식이 계속 확산함에 따라, 퀘벡 주의 긴장도가 높아지고 있습니다. 대규모 징병과 같이 인망 없는 조치는 폭동, 아니면 그보다 더 심한 사태를 유발할 수 있습니다."

CAN_winter_soldiers:0 "Cold Weather Training"
CAN_winter_soldiers_desc:0 "There are few places on earth with as harsh an environment as Northern Canada. We should establish barracks in the outback to serve as training utilities to accustom our soldiers to harsher climates. While this might upset new recruits, they will thank us when they see their enemies freeze to death before them without firing a shot."

CAN_superior_gunnery:0 "Quick Fire Plans"
CAN_superior_gunnery_desc:0 "While giving the responsibility of artillery strikes to commanding officers might seem like an easy answer, it can often cost armies valuable time and even cause lost opportunities. Giving the right for those who request artillery strikes to call them will allow us to make artillery support more flexible, and frankly more useful."

CAN_uranium_supply:0 "Northern Uranium Supply"
CAN_uranium_supply_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, the frozen Northern lands of Canada are not just home to gold mines. Radium and Uranium have been found in absolutely massive quantities all over the Northwest Territories. We already know we will use the Radium for clocks and meters, but according to our scientists, Uranium could have an infinitely more powerful use."

CAN_cbc_idea:0 "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"
CAN_cbc_idea_desc:0 "The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the natural continuation of our efforts to found a respected national radio service, with the British Broadcasting Corporation subverted by the Syndicalists and the Imperial Broadcasting Corporation mostly ignored by Canadians."

CAN_aircanada_idea:0 "Trans-Canada Airlines"
CAN_aircanada_idea_desc:0 "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."

CAN_common_chassis_idea:0 "Chassis Commonality"
CAN_common_chassis_idea_desc:0 "One of the most important parts of automotive engineering is simply trying to standardise production as much as possible. By ensuring that all our motorised, mechanised and armoured divisions share the same basic chassis, we can speed up the construction of current and new designs."

CAN_common_components_idea:0 "Component Commonality"
CAN_common_components_idea_desc:0 "Ever since the breakthrough of replaceable parts, all guns have been made of the same parts to allow easy replacement and building. However, we can go one step further and ensure that all designs in one category share the same parts, and even new designs try to incorporate them, massively reducing production times of weapons and artillery pieces, new and old."

CAN_navy_school_idea:0 "Royal Roads Naval College"
CAN_navy_school_idea_desc:0 "The Royal Roads Naval College is our brand new naval officer training school. Its construction has given us some time to rethink our officer training courses, and this will probably allow us to ensure that the next generation of admirals will be the top of the cream, enough to teach the Kriegsmarine a thing or two about modern naval warfare."

CAN_asw_idea:0 "Anti-Submarine Pickets"
CAN_asw_idea_desc:0 "While submarines pose an existential threat to our convoys, we are far from defenceless against them. By dedicating certain Destroyer models to act as mobile detection platforms, we can ensure that any submarine foolish enough to prey on escorted convoys is routed or destroyed."

CAN_sub_idea:0 "Fleet Support Submarines"
CAN_sub_idea_desc:0 "Seeing their vulnerability to screening ships, having submarines engage with the rest of our navies in naval battles might seem insane. However, there are some naval doctrine concepts to be explored here. Do submarines really have to be relegated to sinking convoys, or do they have more potential?"

CAN_victory_ships_idea:0 "Victory Ships"
CAN_victory_ships_idea_desc:0 "Big battleships with naval artillery, carriers with swarms of naval fighters and submarines sending enemy supplies down into the abyss are all quite impressive, but it is none than the humble convoy that carries the backbone of our efforts. Carrying the supplies of our victory, fearless to the risks of the prowling submarine. Onwards, Victory ships!"

CAN_air_training_plan_idea:0 "Dominion Air Training Plan"
CAN_air_training_plan_idea_desc:0 "Air Training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

entente_training_plan_idea:0 "Entente Air Training Scheme"
entente_training_plan_idea_desc:0 "Air Training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

CAN_loyalist_dissent:0 "Loyalist Dissent"
CAN_loyalist_dissent_desc:0 "Loyalist politicians and those who support them are in an uproar due to our recent policy decisions. They accuse us of attempting to strike right at the Crown of England, and at large against the liberation of the English motherland."

CAN_liberal_dissent:0 "Liberal Dissent"
CAN_loyalist_dissent_desc:0 "Liberal politicians and those who support them are in an uproar due to our recent policy decisions. They accuse us of attempting to subvert democracy in Canada in favour of jingoistic pursuits and of generally ignoring the pleas of the Canadian people"

CAN_forts:0 "National Defence Scheme"
CAN_forts_desc:0 "Recent concerns over the stability of the United States has caused a significant push for the construction of new fortifications and the expansion of existing networks. Should push come to shove, we will ensure that any conflict in the American continent does not bleed over into Canada."

can_professional_army:0 "Quality Training"
can_professional_army_desc:0 "Some armies might pride themselves in having a lot of blokes running around with rifles, but we pride ourselves with having one of the most disciplined and organised armies the world knows. Where mass conscripted Germans and Syndicalist militias flee against a few volleys of gunfire, we stand against the fires of Hell with a stiff upper lip."

CAN_cadets_idea:0 "Mandatory Cadet Enrolment"
CAN_cadets_idea_desc:0 "As mandated by our King, all youth must serve in a branch of the Cadet Corps during their later years, ensuring that they have already received satisfactory discipline training and baseline military training by the time they are old enough to serve and fight for their beloved country."

CAN_tory_plan:0 "Tory Economic Plan"
CAN_tory_plan_desc:0 "The issues of our military industry in the Weltkrieg has made it patently obvious that we must promote government intervention in the arms industry. The Tories however want us to go even further. By nationalising large swaths of our industry, we ensure that the entire economy is mobilised and ready for another total war."

CAN_compromise_plan_idea:0 "Compromise Economic Plan"
CAN_compromise_plan_desc:0 "The issues of our military industry in the Weltkrieg has made it patently obvious that we must promote government intervention in the arms industry. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to subsidise every single last small arms factory, and instead we have reached a compromise where only the heaviest industries will receive government assistance."

CAN_stlaurent_police:0 "St. Laurent Committee"
CAN_stlaurent_police_desc:0 "The St. Laurent Committee oversees the security of our country by investigating dissidents and general unrest. While it has drawn criticism from the liberals as some sort of secret police committee, we see it as a compromise between letting Syndicalists subvert our country, and the Tories' plan for an overt secret police under the Mounties."

bishop_chief_air:0 "Chief of Air Bishop"
bishop_chief_air_desc:0 "Willian Avery Bishop has been given oversight on a plan to modernise the air force. While he is no aeronautic engineer, his plan combines increased funding in research and infrastructure. Our scientists have already begun to use our funding on new airplane projects, now we just need to start expanding and modernising our air fields."

CAN_nylon_idea:0 "Polymer Corporation"
CAN_nylon_idea_desc:0 "The Polymer Corporation is the forefront of the development of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. This, in turn, allows us to discover new, efficient ways to produce specialised equipment pieces that had until then been a nightmare for our industry to produce, like electronics, medical supplies or optics."

minister_of_everything:0 "Minister of Everything"

IRE_canaid_civ:0 "Canadian Economic Aid"
IRE_canaid_civ_desc:0 "We are receiving significant amounts of economic aid from Canada. No doubt is this not altruistic however, as the English don't hide their ambitions of returning to the English Isles. In the meantime, this will help us stand up against this perverted Union of Britain and their dangerous influence."

IRE_canaid_mil:0 "Canadian Military Aid"
IRE_canaid_mil_desc:0 "We are receiving significant amounts of military aid from Canada. No doubt is this not altruistic however, as the English don't hide their ambitions of returning to the English Isles. In the meantime, this will help us stand up against this perverted Union of Britain and their dangerous influence."

IRE_canaid_nav:0 "Canadian Naval Aid"
IRE_canaid_nav_desc:0 "We are receiving significant amounts of naval aid from Canada. No doubt is this not altruistic however, as the English don't hide their ambitions of returning to the English Isles. In the meantime, this will help us stand up against this perverted Union of Britain and their dangerous influence."

### Focuses ###

CAN_isac:0 "ISAC 설립"
CAN_isac_desc:0 "토론토에서 열린 다수의 대학 총장과 과학 지도자들은 대영 제국 회원국 간의 연구 협력을 위한 새로운 기구의 설립을 요청했습니다. 이 관계를 통합하는 작업은 캐나다와 다른 협상국의 지원을 받는, 캐나다의 제국 과학 학회 위원회에서 수행하기로 했습니다."

CAN_works:0 "공공 사업"
CAN_works_desc:0 "새로운 인프라 및 개발 프로젝트 및 기타 공공 사업은 대공황의 최악의 여파를 완화하고 초기 산업에 귀중한 경험과 전문 지식을 제공하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 시간이 지남에 따라 우리는 새로운 경제 호황을 누릴 수 있습니다. 우리는 빠르게 이익을 얻을 것입니다."

CAN_cbc:0 "CBC 설립"
CAN_cbc_desc:0 "A proposal has been put forward to expand the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission into a full-fledged national radio network called the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This would help bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive foreign broadcasts."

CAN_production:0 "현대화된 생산 시설"
CAN_production_desc:0 "Investing in the development of new production techniques will make our industry more efficient and productive. This, in turn will help revive and revitalise our fledgling economy and ensure its long term prosperity."

CAN_polycorp:0 "Polymer Corporation"
CAN_polycorp_desc:0 "The Polymer Corporation, or Polycorp, is a crown corporation tasked with the development and production of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. These new materials will allow us to discover new ways to produce equipment that has until then proved a problem for our industry, making them cheaper and faster to output."

CAN_factory:0 "왕립 기업"
CAN_factory_desc:0 "Enterprises founded and run by the state, so-called 'Crown Corporations', allow us to develop and maintain access to strategic resources and expertise that might otherwise by neglected or ignored by the market. Sadly, not every industrial magnate sees the use of investing in wartime resources, at least for now."

CAN_factory3:0 "국민주택법"
CAN_factory3_desc:0 "Housing is a both a basic necessity and a major source of economic activity. By providing incentives for the construction and purchase of homes, we can create demand for key industries and promote expansion of the industrial economy as a whole."

CAN_infra:0 "CN 철도 확장"
CAN_infra_desc:0 "Rail networks are the arteries of the nation of Canada, and none more so than the state-run Canadian National Railway. Expanding this network can only strengthen the nation, and it will surely prove crucial should we need to perform wartime supply and troops transport across the nation."

CAN_aircanada:0 "Trans-Canada 항공사"
CAN_aircanada_desc:0 "A national airline service will help unify this vast and scattered nation in a way that roads and railways cannot due to sheer size, terrain or weather. The infrastructure, organisation and training developed for this project could also have military applications in the future."

CAN_infra2:0 "CP Rail에 보조금 지원"
CAN_infra2_desc:0 "It was only the promise of a trans-continental rail network that brought the western provinces into the Dominion. Maintaining and expanding this network will help ensure our continued control over the region, and will serve us should we ever require large-scale fret between both seas."

CAN_infra_3:0 "해양 철도 확장"
CAN_infra_3_desc:0 "The likely site of any invasion from Europe, and the launch point of any attempt to reclaim the Home Islands, the maritime provinces and their infrastructure are a critical national security concern. We must ensure that no amount of supplies or troops going through causes issues."

CAN_resource:0 "천연 자원 투자"
CAN_resource_desc:0 "Much of the nation's wealth lies in its untapped natural resources. While prospecting and exploiting all those deposits hidden in Canada's wasts and wilderness will take time, we can take advantage of this natural bounty to ensure our strength and independence."

CAN_mine:0 "북쪽 탐험"
CAN_mine_desc:0 "Before we can mine it, we have to find it. While the large forests have long been explored by civilian prospectors, only state-funded geological expeditions will dare venture into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions to identify the best sites for excavation and extraction."

CAN_oil:0 "대초원 석유 조사"
CAN_oil_desc:0 "There has been small scale drilling in the prairies of Alberta and Saskatchewan for a while. But perhaps there is more of this critical resource waiting for those who bother to look. Perhaps we might even be sitting on fields of oil that would rival the US' current monopoly in America?"

CAN_rocketfuel:0 "고체 추진제"
CAN_rocketfuel_desc:0 "Research into synthetic materials has yielded unexpected developments in stable solid-state combustibles. More research in this direction could be a great boon to military rocket development. This, in turn, could turn a new page of warfare, with rockets turning into the new bombers."

CAN_uranium:0 "북부 우라늄 매장지"
CAN_uranium_desc:0 "We've identified a large supply of Uranium in the Arctic regions, with the biggest pockets situated in our Northwest Territories. This resource has become critical in the developing field of atomic energy, used as a 'fuel' of sorts, and production of it on this scale will give us a leading edge in atomic research and construction. Or maybe even more."

CAN_nrc:0 "국가 연구 위원회"
CAN_nrc_desc:0 "The National Research Council was founded during the Weltkrieg to advise the Canadian government on science and research. By providing the organisation with additional funding and support we can expand our technology base to the benefit of both industry and military."

CAN_nightwatch:0 "The Night Watchmen"
CAN_nightwatch_desc:0 "A proposal has been put forward by the NRC to construct a prototype radar warning system, code-name 'Night Watchmen'. In addition to its immediate strategic utility, this program would provide enormous benefit to further research into RADAR technology and integration into air doctrine."

CAN_eti:0 "Electronics Training Initiative"
CAN_eti_desc:0 "We should take it upon ourselves to train a cadre of experts to man and maintain radios, RADAR and other modern electronic weapons of war. The RADAR is no simple technology, and we will need competent engineers and field operators to ensure our stations work at maximal efficiency, especially as we build more."

CAN_chalk_river:0 "Chalk River Labs"
CAN_chalk_river_desc:0 "Atomic technology has enormous potential to transform industry and warfare. Establishing a laboratory to develop these technologies will help ensure we maintain a competitive edge in this field. We might even achieve breakthroughs in atomic energy generation, or as some scientists suggest, discover the basics of an atomic weapon."

CAN_halifax_project:0 "The Halifax Project"
CAN_halifax_project_desc:0 "There has been enough speculation and theorising about the possibilities of atomic power. We are now certain an atomic weapon is within our reach, and we will begin a secret project to develop and deploy what might be the ultimate and most terrifying weapon ever designed: The Atomic Bomb."

CAN_C7:0 "Draft Bill C-7"
CAN_C7_desc:0 "Now that he has assumed the throne, young King Edward plans his first move. By introducing bill C-7, a sweeping piece of omnibus legislation that addresses the poor state of the industry, military, and internal security, he hopes to prove himself to his new subjects. The first proposals are already on his desk for reforming the military and industry of Canada."

CAN_army_command:0 "Reorganise the Army"
CAN_army_command_desc:0 "The current Canadian army is a strange mix of a national militia surrounding a core of exiled British professionals. With war looming on the horizon, it is time to reorganise the Canadian Army into a unified fighting force, taking inspiration of the legacy of the grand British Army and her achievements in the Weltkrieg."

CAN_grand_battle_doctrine:0 "Currie's Prepared Battle"
CAN_grand_battle_doctrine_desc:0 "Arthur Currie, a respected commander of the Canadian Corps during the Weltkrieg, proposes a theory of warfare developed from his experiences on the Western Front. His approach emphasises careful planning and the close co-operation of infantry and heavy artillery to overcome enemy fortifications."

CAN_mobile_doctrine:0 "Fuller's Combined Arms"
CAN_mobile_doctrine_desc:0 "An ardent Monarchist and early advocate of mechanisation, JFC Fuller believes the static trench warfare that typified the Weltkrieg has been rendered obsolete by modern technology. Fuller proposes instead an emphasis on fast, highly mobile warfare in which tanks and motorised infantry perform breakthroughs and envelop the enemy line."

CAN_artillery_effort:0 "Artillery Effort"
CAN_artillery_effort_desc:0 "On the modern industrial battlefield, artillery is king. This much has been proven extensively in the Weltkrieg, and the guns of the interwar only get larger and scarier by the minute. We must modernise our artillery armaments if we hope to stand against our foes."

CAN_artillery_school:0 "Flexible Fire Control"
CAN_artillery_school_desc:0 "By devolving the responsibility of calling fire support missions to frontline observers, we can provide flexible and responsive artillery support to both support our attacks and blunt enemy offensives, without risking failed offensives due to overly rigid or unresponsive commanders."

CAN_heavy_tank:0 "Infantry Tank Focus"
CAN_heavy_tank_desc:0 "Our infantry will be supported in the field by heavy tanks, which will provide cover, heavy fire support, and the ability to cross or destroy enemy fortifications. In a way, the heavy tank will become the mighty centrepiece of the infantry push, calling our boys forward as they plow through the enemy."

CAN_heavy_tank2:0 "Rolling Fortresses"
CAN_heavy_tank2_desc:0 "Developed from our Infantry Tank doctrine, the Mobile Fortress takes the concept to its logical conclusion in the form of slow but incredibly well armed and armoured 'Heavy Tanks'. These are capable of stopping anything short of equally armed tanks, making our pushes slow but resilient."

CAN_infantry_equipment:0 "Improved Infantry Weapons"
CAN_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Tanks and artillery are all well and good, but at the end of the day wars are still won by the infantry. We must ensure they have adequate equipment for the job. Rifles, grenades and clothing that will allow them to perform their best while our fancier pieces clear the way."

CAN_light_tank:0 "Cruiser Tank Focus"
CAN_light_tank_desc:0 "The 'Cruiser Tank' is a fast, relatively lightly armed and armoured vehicle designed to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy line and achieve rapid advances and encirclement. In a way, it is the spiritual successor of the cavalry charge, which certainly seems to appeal to our generals."

CAN_motorize:0 "Motorised Infantry"
CAN_motorize_desc:0 "Automobile technology has come a long way since the Weltkrieg. By harnessing the opportunity of mass produced vehicles, we can field whole divisions capable of deploying rapidly and supporting fast armoured advances. Speed on foot is no longer a limiting factor in warfare, horsepower now rules."

CAN_support_tech:0 "Organic Support Elements"
CAN_support_tech_desc:0 "The modern industrialised army is increasingly in need of specialised support elements, like engineers and scouts, to achieve the best results in the field. We should focus effort on developing these capabilities, and ensure that they receive the best equipment we can produce."

CAN_spg:0 "Self-Propelled Guns"
CAN_spg_desc:0 "A mobile army requires mobile fire support. By mounting an artillery weapon on the same platforms as tanks we can economically provide a full range of capabilities to our mechanised divisions and provide the kind of on-point fire support that will seal the deal on most armoured pushes."

CAN_mech_infantry:0 "Mechanised Infantry"
CAN_mech_infantry_desc:0 "Developing on our experiences with motorised infantry comes proposals to build a frontline armoured troop transport, one which carries its own light armament, to support mechanised advances. This ensures our infantry can not only be deployed on the front, but keep their vehicle for fighting."

CAN_colossus:0 "The Colossus Project"
CAN_colossus_desc:0 "Electronics have come a long way since the tabulating machine and the telegraph. We have developed a top secret project to build an enormous and powerful electronic computing system, primarily to assist in decrypting encoded enemy transmissions. We may even discover new applications for those computing machines, military or otherwise."

CAN_navy_focus:0 "Strengthen the Navy"
CAN_navy_focus_desc:0 "If Canada is to defend itself, much less reclaim the British Homeland, it must first develop a first-rate navy. Fortunately, the legacy of the once-great Royal Navy provides a perfect foundation, and restarting from scratch allows us to get the most up-to-date navy possible."

CAN_navy_bb:0 "Support the Admiralty"
CAN_navy_bb_desc:0 "The Admiralty believes that the Battleship remains the undisputed master of the seas, and our naval strength should be arranged around protecting and supporting these massive weapons in decisive battles against the enemy fleet. Let the naval artillery roar across the Atlantic Ocean once more!"

CAN_navy_cv:0 "Support the Fleet Air Arm"
CAN_navy_cv_desc:0 "The FAA was founded soon after the Weltkrieg as the aviation arm of the Royal Navy, and its officers advocate for a new theory of naval warfare built around the aircraft carrier as the primary weapon of the fleet. Naval Bombers can threaten any fleet, and planes are starting to become a fearsome weapon of war."

CAN_dockyards:0 "National Shipbuilding Strategy"
CAN_dockyards_desc:0 "Canada's naval production capacity is barely adequate to maintain the former Royal Fleet, much less expand it back to its previous glory. A national program of intensive shipyard expansion will be necessary to achieve naval supremacy once again and ensure our efforts do not go to waste."

CAN_navy_school:0 "Royal Roads Naval College"
CAN_navy_school_desc:0 "The admiralty has submitted a request to establish a new officer training school, to be called the Royal Roads Naval College. A site has already been selected on what was once a private estate adjacent to our facilities in Esquimalt. This will also allow us to review our current naval doctrines and training."

CAN_marines:0 "Expeditionary Warfare"
CAN_marines_desc:0 "Our most pressing threats lie across the Atlantic. We must build a military capable of taking and holding ground across the ocean, performing naval invasion operations of a scale the world has never known before. This much will become a challenge in and out of itself, but we will face it."

CAN_navy_escort:0 "Escort Focus"
CAN_navy_escort_desc:0 "Our capital ships are under constant threat of torpedo attacks from fast Destroyers and Submarines. It is critical we have a capable fleet of escort vessels to protect more expensive and vulnerable warships, creating a sort of screen in front of our valuable ships, and even being able to punish the enemy for exposing theirs."

CAN_navy_cruiser:0 "Heavy Cruiser Focus"
CAN_navy_cruiser_desc:0 "Everywhere that you can't afford to send a battleship, you send a heavy cruiser, the real workhorse of any credible naval force. We should not neglect to advance our design capabilities with ships of this type. Flexibility will no doubt be one of the new credos of the reformed Royal Navy."

CAN_navy_aviation:0 "Carrier Aircraft Focus"
CAN_navy_aviation_desc:0 "An aircraft carrier is only as useful as the aircraft it fields. If we do not invest in capable naval plans than our expensive carriers will be nothing but a very expensive, floating, useless husk of scrap metal."

CAN_navy_asw:0 "Anti-Sub Pickets"
CAN_navy_asw_desc:0 "German U-Boats proved a decisive weapon during the Weltkrieg. It is critical we improve our ability to detect these weapons and protect our capital ships and merchant marine by using specialised Destroyers loaded to the brim with cutting-edge anti-Submarine technologies."

CAN_navy_submarine:0 "Expand the Silent Service"
CAN_navy_submarine_desc:0 "The Submarine has proved to be a highly effective weapon, but has long been viewed with disdain by the traditionalists in the Admiralty and even by servicemen.

CAN_victory_ships:0 "Victory Ships"
CAN_victory_ships_desc:0 "To supply our industry at home and armies abroad it is critical we undertake a program of mass production of naval transports.

CAN_navy_bb2:0 "Modern Battleship Effort"
CAN_navy_bb2_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to stay on the forefront of battleship design. Our naval engineers have a few proposals that deserve exploration, and we should also consider implementing new modules to account for recent technological advances, like RADAR and radio stations, or heavy AA guns."

CAN_navy_cv2:0 "Modern Carrier Effort"
CAN_navy_cv2_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier has proven itself the supreme weapon of the seas. It is critical that we maintain research and design efforts to maintain this supremacy, and consider massively expanding our fleet of carriers to ensure that our planes reach every corner of the world."

CAN_rcaf_focus:0 "Expand the Air Force"
CAN_rcaf_focus_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Air force fought with distinction during the Weltkrieg, but has long since suffered from serious neglect. We can no longer afford to fall behind in this critical area of warfare, lest we cede control the sky to our foes, a terrifying prospect for sure."

CAN_rcaf_tac_focus:0 "National Airspace Defence"
CAN_rcaf_tac_focus_desc:0 "The main purpose of the air force should be to protect our land and armies from enemy aircraft and provide direct fire support for our troops on the ground. Our skies are now more than a great sight, they are new territory to defend, every single last meter of it"

CAN_rcaf_strat_focus:0 "Strategic Airpower Projection"
CAN_rcaf_strat_focus_desc:0 "The best use of our air force is to project our power over great distances, using massed bombing raids and long range fighters to take the fight deep into enemy's heartland. Their cities and factories will lie in ruins before our boys even finish driving there."

CAN_rcaf_fighter:0 "Fighter Design Competition"

CAN_air_training_plan_desc:0 "No matter how well designed, an aeroplane is ultimately only as good as its pilot. A large and dedicated training program will help ensure we have a healthy supply, and its extension to other members of the Entente will allow us to pool knowledge and help our allies reach our level of greatness."

CAN_coastal_air_defence:0 "Coastal Air Defences"
CAN_coastal_air_defence_desc:0 "Canada has some of the longest coastlines of any nation on Earth, and even with the inherited Royal Navy, they can prove difficult to protect. By deploying land-based naval bombers en masse we can greatly enhance our maritime security at a comparatively low cost."

CAN_rcaf_strat_bomber:0 "Strategic Bomber Initiative"
CAN_rcaf_strat_bomber_desc:0 "If we hope to strike directly at our enemies overseas we will require a very powerful and long-ranged weapon. New proposals for heavy, four-engine bombers would fit that bill, allowing immense payloads to be dropped over the enemies."

CAN_rcaf_fighter_2:0 "Advanced Fighter Design Program"
CAN_rcaf_fighter_2_desc:0 "Aircraft technology has been developing swiftly ever since the biplane finally bit the dust, and already our current fighter designs are starting to feel long in the tooth. It is time to run another design competition to ensure our plane frames are still the top of the cream."

CAN_jet:0 "Turbo Research Inc."
CAN_jet_desc:0 "Although an expensive and immature technology, turbojet aircraft could revolutionise aerial warfare. Let us found Turbo Research Inc. as a crown corporation to pursue this technology with all vigour. If our theorists are right, the speeds this aircraft could achieve would be beyond our comprehension."

One led by Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the other led by Conservative R.B. Bennett and the exiled British aristocracy.

CAN_ireland_treaty:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
CAN_ireland_treaty_desc:0 "The Irish might have an ugly history with the Empire, but they are no friends of the Syndicalists either.

CAN_st_lawrence_line:0 "The St. Lawrence Line"
CAN_st_lawrence_line_desc:0 "The St. Lawrence river runs through the heart of the nation, and presents a logical last line of defence against American invasion. We should fortify it heavily, so that the nation is not skewered and the Quebec basin seized by American bandits."

CAN_georgian_line:0 "The Georgian Line"
CAN_georgian_line_desc:0 "The Georgian line is an incredibly ambitious plan to fortify the entire length of the 49th parallel, hopefully preventing hostile forces from bisecting the nation and encircling the heartland.

CAN_psa_ally:0 "Alliance with the Pacific States"
CAN_psa_ally_desc:0 "Now that we've built up a relationship with the Pacific States, we should seek to bring them formally into the Entente.

canada.1.d:0 "Prime Minister King's government now has a slim majority after the defeat of R.B. Bennett's conservative party and his British backers but not all is secure. George V's health is steadily declining and, despite his sickness, continues to oppose the moderating influence of the Prime Minister on Canadian politics. Senile and obsessed with reclaiming the Empire George V lends influence to the British exiles who now sit in the Canadian House of Lords (formerly the Senate). Their presence in the upper house threatens to endanger the Prime Minister's legislative program. While Canada has grown strong by an influx of expertise, capital and technology, it remains an uncertain player on the world stage.

Bennett and his supporters in the British diaspora who wish to mobilise the Canadian economy to launch an invasion of the Union of Britain in the near future, even if that means accelerating arms production at the expense of civil liberties. The Prince of Wales is popular in both French and English Canada and his views may very well sway the opinions of others.

In doing so they might secure for us a foothold in Ireland putting us within reach our ultimate goal: the restoration of our United Kingdom! Intelligence has also contacted several groups opposed to the new Irish government in the south. While these are no allies of Collins and his IRA they are still Republicans. They are composed of avowed anti-syndicalists and supporters of the National Centre Party and Fianna Fáil who have been forced underground. If we were to help arm and organise these disparate groups into an 'Irish National Army' it would greatly increase our chances of success but would upset members of the loyalist militias who wish for a return of the monarchy to Ireland as well as members of our armed forces for whom the memories of the Irish War are not easily forgotten."

canada.100.d:0 "When the Great war began, the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith said that industry would proceed as 'Business as Usual'. The ensuing shell crisis and the difficulty found in equipping the British army has shown us that if another war were to start, we will need a mobilised war economy. However, most businessmen aren't willing to invest in specialised facilities such as Heavy Bomber factories that such an economy would require. Some Conservative MP's are proposing that part of the Security bill include a provision to immediately nationalise such key war industries. While this wouldn't increase the size of our industrial capacity, it would cut down on a lot of red tape. C.D. Howe, the minister of munitions, argues that the government subsidise the creation of such industries that entrepreneurs would lease at very preferable rates and provide the labour which would increase the number of factories, but limit their efficiency by working with the private sector. Some MP's are arguing for a compromise where the government will nationalise the specialised industries that require a great deal of sophistication while subsidising the more basic ones already in place."

While Canada was able to seize the Caribbean, we were unable to secure the rest of the Empire and had to rely on the Australasians to secure a perimeter around their territory. Many regard this as a result of our small army at that time, and many would like resurrect the conscription bill. However, the Prime Minister is a Liberal in the mould of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and will not lightly allow such a divisive law to be promulgated without intense debate. The conservatives want universal conscription, while the progressives within the Liberal party have threatened to leave if the government goes ahead. Conscription is deeply unpopular, especially in Quebec. The Prime Minister has declared “Conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription!” Many are taking this as a sign that he is working to build a consensus."

He believes that the current economic system was designed to create a plutocracy through unnecessary scarcity and that the workers needed to be freed from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production. Douglas' reform program contains two main elements, a national dividend to distribute money equally to all citizens to bridge the gap between earning power and prices, and a price adjustment mechanism that would forestall the possibility of inflation. Now that we are in power we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However, critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalist' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger."

Princess Isabelle, daughter of Orleanist pretender, met His Majesty, at the time prince of Wales, during his visit to Algiers shortly before the British Revolution of 1925, and managed to catch his attention with her intelligence, linguistic abilities, and first-hand experience of Great War, during which she served as a nurse. Prince and princess met again in 1927, and shortly after began their not-so-well-hidden affair, despite princess Isabelle being married and already a mother. While His Majesty didn't manage to convince his father, king George V, to allow him to marry princess Isabelle after her first husband's death in 1930, he appeared with her on several occasions after she moved to Canada in late 1930. During the time, princess managed to win the people's support, especially in Quebec area, which proved to be very valuable for His Majesty tirelessly fighting for improving image of the monarchy.
